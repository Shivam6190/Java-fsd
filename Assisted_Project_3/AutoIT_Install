Selenium cannot interact with desktop applicaions

If we have to upload files from a windows laptop thenw e ahve to integrate selenium with AutoIT

AutoIT tool lets you write a script --> compile the scripts , using which we  will handle and interact with desktop application

First selenium will work on webpage

Then we give control to autoIT tool to perform the desktop related action

===================

As part of thsi scenario: we will go to


https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

1. Download autoIT

https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

2. Then on the same page you will click on AutoIt Script Editor.

We need to write the script

On your windows machine search for editor-> scite

It will open the editor:

ControlFocus("Open","","Edit1")
ControlSetText("Open","","Edit1","C:\Users\sonal\Documents\ATE-Phase1-SL\JDBCconnectivity.png")
ControlClick("Open","","Button1")


To find the element--> on windows machine --> search for tool AutoIT windows info --> open it

drag the finder tool on the text box. itwill show details in box: class and instance

so element location is : classinstance => Edit1

Similarly for open button ==> it is Button1

======================

Once the script is ready, save the script on your windows machine

Right click on the script --> clcik on Show more options  and select compile the script.

A compiled file will be available in the folder.
================

This compiled file will be executed in selenium script

Give this code

Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\Users\\sonal\\Desktop\\AutiitScripts\\Scriptupload3.exe");
========================================
